SAMI Trials Android SDK
=======================

This SDK helps you connect your Android apps to SAMI Trials. The SDK exposes a number of methods to easily execute REST API calls to SAMI Trials. 

Prerequisites
-------------

 * [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) 
 * [Maven Integration for Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) or [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
 * Wordnik
 * Jackson JSON Processor  2.1.4
 * JUnit 4.8.1
 * Apache HTTP Client 4.0
 
The SDK was developed with Eclipse and Maven and tested with Android 4.4.2. When building Maven will fetch the correct libraries. You might be able to build the SDK in a different environment and we would be happy to hear about your (success) stories.

If you need to exercise core SAMI functionality, then you need to import the [sami-android](https://github.com/samsungsamiio/sami-android) SDK as well. 

Installation
---------------------

In Eclipse, 
- import the SDK library project as "Existing Maven Projects".
- right click the project, and choose "Run As" then "Maven install"

After the installation succeeds, you can use the generated libraries in one of the following ways depending on your scenario:

- To use them in an Android project, copy libraries under `target` and `target/lib` directories of the imported Maven project to `libs` directory in your Android project.
- To use them in your Maven project, modify `pom.xml` file in your project to add dependency to sami-android-xxx.jar under `target` of the imported Maven project as following

~~~
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.samsungsami.trials</groupId>
   <artifactId>samitrials-android</artifactId>
   <version>the actual version number</version>
</dependency>
~~~

Finally, in your Android project's `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the permissions required by the SDK library. You could accomplish this automatically if you are using manifest merger (`manifestmerger.enabled`, requires SDK tools rev 20 or above).

~~~
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
~~~

You're ready to go.
